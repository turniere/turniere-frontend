# turniere-frontend

## Prerequisites

You'll need Node.js and a package manager for Node.js (like npm or Yarn; We recommend Yarn) installed on your system in order to run this program. You can see how to install Node.js [here](https://nodejs.org/en/).

## Setup the project

First of course you'll need to clone this repository:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/turniere/turniere-frontend.git
```

Afterwards you'll have to navigate into the created folder and install several libraries using following command:

```
$ yarn add react react-dom reactstrap next express @zeit/next-css axios
```

Alternatively you can simply use our dependencies file:

```
yarn install
```

Afterwards you may simply run the developer version of the project:

```
$ yarn run dev
```
